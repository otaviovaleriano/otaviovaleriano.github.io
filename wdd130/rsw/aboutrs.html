                Joseph Merlin, a Belgian, invented the first roller skates in 1750 when he came up with the notion of making skates that could walk on the ground like ice skates. Merlin succeeded to develop roller skates with only one wheel on each foot after several
                attempts, and as soon as the creation was complete, the inventor decided to give a triumphal presentation to the local society to show off his achievement.

                Roller skates, despite being an intriguing concept, did not gain popularity soon. Many unidentified inventors, on the other hand, continue to improve Merlin's notion. M. O Petitbled was the first to patent the new roller skates in France in 1819, and
                Roberto John Tyers was the second to patent the "Rollito" model in 1823. The "Rollito" was defined in the patent document as a "device with wheels attached to shoes, boots, or other element that covers the foot, for the purpose of locomotion
                and pleasure."
            </p>
            <p>
                Five wheels were used to create the "Rollito," which was designed in a straight line. It immediately attracted the public's interest and didn't stop getting more complex after that. Despite their popularity, roller skates took a long time to attain widespread
                acceptance. It was only recognized in 1840 in Germany, for example. Customers were lured to a store by having girls serve them on skates at the time.
            </p>

                From 1863 onwards, with all the modifications that were gradually added, the skates grew increasingly similar to the so-called traditional skates or "quads" (two pairs of parallel wheels, fixed on two axles, on each foot) as they are generally known.
